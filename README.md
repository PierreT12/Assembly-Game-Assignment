# Assembly-Game-Assignment
One of my final assembly assignments where we were tasked with making a game. It had to meet a few requirements such as:  
Random number generation  
Use of a Seven Segment LED System  
Fractional Math  


# About the Game

**Neo Bonk- The Game**   


Neo Bonk is a game where The Player's goal is to dodge being hit by blocks coming down from the top of the screen by moving left or right.  
Over time the blocks will get faster but max out as to not get impossibly fast.  
These blocks also spawn at random points on the top of the screen.  
The longer they stay alive the more points they get(this maxes out at 999).  
But if The Player gets hit once, they're dead and will get a Game Over.  
After the game has ended The Player can save their score and see their last score to try for a higher one next time!
